# Microservice training
## How to use this project?
To run the project simply ```mvn spring-boot:run``` at each of the microservice folder. Basically you should run this command where there is a ```pom.xml``` file, where this ```pom.xml``` is the Project Object Model file (thus POM), or similar like ```package.json``` for ```npm``` installation.
